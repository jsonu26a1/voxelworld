# Update 2023-12-04
I decided to use a rust wrapper around bgfx instead of trying to learn Vulkan. Currently, the
main.rs has a hello_winit example, that I adapted for newer version of winit. Next, I need to
work on getting a custom shader, rendering a 3d terrain like in the SimonDev videos, and
eventually getting a camera and input-movement system so I can explore the world.

Here are the new resources I'll be using now that I'm using bgfx-rs.
