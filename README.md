# Update 2023-12-04
I decided to use a rust wrapper around bgfx instead of trying to learn Vulkan. Currently, the
main.rs has a hello_winit example, that I adapted for newer version of winit. Next, I need to
work on getting a custom shader, rendering a 3d terrain like in the SimonDev videos, and
eventually getting a camera and input-movement system so I can explore the world.

Here are the new resources I'll be using now that I'm using bgfx-rs.

# TODO list
The hello_winit has basically no 3D boilerplate. Our first step should be to figure out what
state we need to pass onto a new module where our "game" will live. It might also be tied
into receiving event loop signals, not sure. Next, we could look at the examples (see
[bgfx-rs](https://github.com/emoon/bgfx-rs/tree/main/examples) and
[bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/tree/master/examples)) and get a demo working, then
we should look into following the "shaders for beginners" guide, along with rust crates for
compiling shader scripts, and finally plugging those into bgfx-rs.
